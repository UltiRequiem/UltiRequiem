# Roadmap

The Roadmap defines the [project](./ABOUT.md) direction.

I'm still not very clear about what role I would like to take in the future. In
general I like the backend side of applications more than the frontend when it
comes to web development.

About my tech stack, I don't have it that defined either. My 3 Favorite
Languages are Golang, JavaScript and Python.
