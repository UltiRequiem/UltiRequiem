**Hey, I'm Eliaz! 👋🏽**

I'm a web and system developer based on Peru, who has a passion to build things
that impact lives to make them better. Currently I'm interested in Deno, Rust,
Next.js, and building apps + developer tools.

In my free time, you can catch me reading manga, playing flute, reading/writing
blogs, and talking new people :)
