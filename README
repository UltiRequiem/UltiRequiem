Hi, I'm a 15 years old high school student, self-taught programmer who loves working with Typescript ⚡ and Go 🐹.

I'm looking forward to collaborate on any interesting project because I want to gain experience working in teams 👨‍💻.

So far I have only been doing CLI tools and APIs, but now I am trying to do frontend development 🦄.
